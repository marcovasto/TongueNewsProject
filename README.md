# Marco Vasto Portfolio - Frontend Developer

This portfolio website showcases the skills and projects I’ve developed throughout my journey as a Frontend Developer. The website was created as part of a hands-on project during my master’s program at start2impact, where I explored various web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, and GitHub.

The website reflects my commitment to modern, high-quality web development. It features a clean, user-friendly design and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. It demonstrates practical application of responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes, along with a meticulous focus on pixel-perfect spacing for a polished and visually consistent layout.
